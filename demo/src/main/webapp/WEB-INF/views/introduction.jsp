<p>This website is built on openshift. The techniques I use are bootstrap, JSP, tiles, Spring, Spring 4 MVC, postgres, hibernate, maven and git. I have been coding for 8 years. 1 year on my thesis, 7 years on web-site developer. 
I have faced many challenges in this road. Coding is difficult, but I love it.</p>
